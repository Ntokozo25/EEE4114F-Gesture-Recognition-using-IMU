# EEE4114F-Gesture-Recognition-using-IMU

This is a machine learning project that uses data from the IMU of the smartphone to classify predefined gestures. These gestures are limited to up & down movement, left & right movement, and clockwise movement. 

The project implements concepts from deep learning model combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
